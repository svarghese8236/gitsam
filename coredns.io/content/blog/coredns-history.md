> Yes, at some point CoreDNS was actually a forked webserver doing DNS.

This blog posts detail some of the early history of CoreDNS.

Pondering if I should create someting ala Caddy, but then for DNS. I didn't have a name,
so it was "Caddy DNS" (or Daddy as some point): <https://miek.nl/2016/march/10/caddy-dns/>.

This idea was good enough that I actually tried it out, resulting in the first queries answered
by "Caddy DNS": <https://miek.nl/2016/march/14/first-light/>.

Started to believe this "Caddy DNS" might actually be a thing I would work on:
<https://miek.nl/2016/march/17/caddy-dns-update/>

Officially announcing CoreDNS: <https://miek.nl/2016/march/18/announcing-coredns/> and dropping
the name "Caddy DNS".
